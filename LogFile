Greek Life APP Log File 

4/11/2013 (Vinnie Vendemia)

- Added Process loader to Splash Screen

- Created class ListLoader, an AsyncTask that loads all the lists before the app starts running 
 
- HttpConnectionFailedThrowable
	- When attempting to do a query if the connection fails, throw this, catch it in calling function
		and make a toast (as done in FratView class)
		
- ActionBar, 
	- now basically the main view of the app.  After SplashScreen has run, ActionBar appears 

- Main Activity 
	- now just contains a search bar, search still functions as normal, However, need to figure out a way 
		so that after the search is performed, the output still remains in the tabView (ActionBar)
		
Event 
	- Now implements parcelable, so it can be passed into a new Activity through Intent 
	
EventListLoader 
	- loads all the events that the user is subscribed too in an AsyncTask 
		- Upon failure, a failure Event is added to the list, the list will still appear, 
			but there will only be 1 event, a failure event, that basically notifies the 
			user that the event query has failed 
	- executed from the SplashScreen so all events are loaded upon App Start 
	
EventView 
	- Only has to find names of subscribed events
	- No longer has to calculate what events the user is subscribed too
